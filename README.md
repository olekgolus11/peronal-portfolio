<p align="center">My first project with the use of WebGL</p>

## Genesis
In 2020 I became interested in CGI and I was excited with how much it can offer. When I first encountered this [Bruno Simon's portfolio website](https://bruno-simon.com) in late 2021 I realised that I could create something unique and beautiful with the use of WebGL, but I didn't have any experience in web development... so I began my learning journey. Since then I've spent so much time and effort learning all of the tools that I needed, and I actually enjoyed it. 
But now that I've learned most of the fundamentals I created [this](https://aleksandergolus.vercel.app) website (not yet üòÅ) and I'm so glad that I did it.

I used React because I know it and I feel comfortable using it.

I wanted to learn more, so I tried Nextjs. I also wanted to use it for my upcoming projects because it's packed with many features (like SSR, Router etc.)

I just can't go back to JS anymore

I've heard so much about Tailwind and I was so excited about it that I finally used it in my project. Since I didn't want to rely on CSS in my portfolio (because of Threejs) I thought that it could be a great starting point to use it.

I actually used React Three Fiber, which provides a declarative way of writing Threejs. It is much more convenient that the original framework.
